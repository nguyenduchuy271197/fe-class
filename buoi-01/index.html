        React was first introduced by Facebook in 2011 and was initially used to
        build dynamic user interfaces for Facebook's social media platform. Over
        the years, React has evolved and grown in popularity, with many
        companies and individual developers adopting it for their projects. In
        2013, React was released as an open-source project and its development
        was taken over by a community of developers. Since then, React has
        become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user
        interfaces, and its popularity continues to grow.

          Reusability: Components in React can be reused, making the development
          process faster and more efficient.
        </li>
        <li>
          Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM, which improves the performance
          of updates to the UI.
        </li>
        <li>
          JSX: React allows developers to use JSX, a syntax extension for
          JavaScript, to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript
          components.
